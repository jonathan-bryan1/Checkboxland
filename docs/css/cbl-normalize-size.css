/*
  Checkboxland itself adds a few styles in order to arrange the checkboxes into a tight grid.

  It does not attempt to style the checkboxes themselves or force them to display the same across browsers.

  However, it can be useful to ensure the checkbox grid itself is the same size across browsers. These styles
  help with that.

  At some point, it may make sense to add this to checkboxland as an option, but I'm leaving it out for now.

  Note: Firefox's checkboxes currently have border-spacing around them, but it can't be overridden since they
        exist in the shadow-root and cannot be customized.

.cbl-normalize-size input[type="checkbox"] {
  /* Ensure the default checkbox size is consistent across all browsers.
     Otherwise, it will uses the browser defaults, which currently look like this:

     Firefox: 14px;
     Edge: 14px;
     Chrome: 14px;
     Safari: 12px;
